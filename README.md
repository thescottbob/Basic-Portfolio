Scott's Basic Portfolio / That Portfolio Though

This portfolio contains a website (index.html) about myself and a number of other supporting files. The coding is not quite complete, so I have included the following pseudocode to outline my plan to finish the website:

1) Each of the three buttons ("About", "Portfolio", and "Contact") must be programmed so that they re-direct to the appropriate tab on the site.
2) The "About" page is nearly complete with information; however, the layouts of the Portfolio and Contact pages still need to be customized.
3) There is work remaining to bring the remaining HTML elements in line with each other.
4) The CSS styling must be completed according to the specifications outlined on GitLab.
