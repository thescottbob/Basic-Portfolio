            <p class="Regular Font Color">I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen. I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.
                I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me. I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider.*</p>

            <p class="Regular Font Color">Despite not literally being Bilbo Baggins, I like to think that I share his taste for adventure. Last year I quit my tedious desk job and went straight to Europe (true story), venturing through a dozen major cities in the United
            </div> Kingdom. Above you can see me at the top of the London Eye, next to my old friend Big Ben, at the conclusion of the voyage of a lifetime. I love to travel, and there are so many more places I wish to go!</p>
